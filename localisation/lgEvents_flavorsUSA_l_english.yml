 lgEvents_flavorUSA.0001.t: "Declaration of American Independence"
 lgEvents_flavorUSA.0001.d: "Thomas Paine, the English-American political activist, author, political theorist and revolutionary who inspired the Patriots to declare independence from Britain, argued in the first edition of 'Common Sense' that the United States needed a formal declaration of American Independence. Without a Declaration of Independence, the United States is considered outlaws by the European nations, rebels against a legitimate monarch, and to transform us into a legitimate nation we need international recognition for our cause and foreign allies to support it. The Declaration of Independence is a statement that announces that the Thirteen States regards themselves as independent states and no longer part of the British Empire."

 lgEvents_flavorDAN.0001.d: "Spain is hard pressed for cash as it was set on a dream of worldwide hegemony. They therefore offered the island of St. Thomas, an island in the Caribbean against a lump sum of 15 million dollars. The $MONARCHTITLE$ and the court agreed. Your Majesty, you would only get the province that Spain presently owns for a lump sum of 1000 ducats. How will you choose, my $MONARCHTITLE$?"
